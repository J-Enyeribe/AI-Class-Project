Project name : AI Tutor system
Motivation : given the increasing demand for personalized education and the limitations of traditional tutoring,
             an AI powered virtualn tutoring system could offer a scalable and effective solution.
Objective : to create an AI powered virtual tutoring system that helps users learn specific subjects by answering
             questions, providing personalized learning plans, intelligent tutoring, adaptive learning, and providing 
              personalized- recommendations.
Features :  1. personalized learning plans  - analyze stydent perfomance data to identify stregths, weaknessess and learning gaps
                                            - taylor plans to individuals needs adjusting pace and difficulty level accordingly
            2. intelligent tutoring - use natural languageprocessing to understand students questions and provide clear and concise instructions
                                    - employ machine learning algorithms to generate practice problems and questions that align with stydents learning objectives.
                                    - provide realtime feedback on students responses highligting errors and suggesting corrections
            3. adaptive learning - continously monitoring students progress, adjust the learning material and pace to optimize learning outscomes
                                 - use reinforcment learning techniques to personalize tutoring experience and maximize students engagement
